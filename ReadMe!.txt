Assignment 3: Make 2D Game
I made a breakout game for example of it are Breakout (1978) [Atari 2600].
For this assignment I aim for pass.
Pass require to have a game with win and fail state. 3 or more game state.
A score and highscore system, animation, parallaxbackground, collision detection and clean code.

I feelt I started this assignment late so I feel much of my code could be unclean.
I too feel that I my have done something unfinish. I am unsure if my parallaxbackground is finish that I going get to know after this grading. 
I hade less then a hour left when I was finish with fallingstar game objects. 

I hope for a good feedback.

How to play the game:
Start screen you press "Spacebar" to get to the game.

In Game:
You use left arrow and right arrow to move the paddle left and right.
The ball bounces on the paddle.
Ball is a sqaure.

The goal of the game is too destroy the red bricks at top. If you destoy them you win.
If the ball touches bottom of the screen you get gameover.

When you win or lose you get to a screen that have text. Press "Spacebar" to play agian.


Reference:
I have not collaborated with other student. I have talked and diskussed ideas. 
I have to look at other students project for insperation however I have not code togther with another student or ask for help with solving bugs. 
When I was stuck I asked my teacher for help most.

I took all logic for texture manager from this github user:
